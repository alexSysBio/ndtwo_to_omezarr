This repository includes functions that can be used to convert, store and read .nd2 microscopy multichannel files into OME-Zarr. Two examples are provided in the <code> apply_omezarr_to_python_github.ipynb </code> notebook with different iteration axes. The Napari viewer is also applied for specific XY positions.
